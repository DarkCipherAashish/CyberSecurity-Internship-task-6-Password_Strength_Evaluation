# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation

This project focuses on understanding what makes a password secure and testing different password patterns using an online strength-checking tool.  
The aim was to compare weak vs. strong passwords and observe how complexity influences security ratings.

## 🛠️ Tool Used

The password checks were performed using:

**PasswordMeter.com** — a real-time password scoring tool that evaluates password strength based on length, diversity, and predictability.

---

## 🧪 Test Cases & Results

| Password Example | Score | Strength Level | Observations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `password123` | ~20% | Weak | Very predictable, uses common word + simple numbers |
| `Pass@1234` | ~50% | Fair | Slight improvement with symbol & uppercase, still weak |
| `P@ssW0rd!2025` | 100% | Strong | Good length, symbols, mixed case & numbers |
| `Cyb3r$ecurity_L@b2025` | 100% | Very Strong | Long phrase, smart substitutions, secure structure |
| `B3tterS@fe_ThanS0rry!2025` | 100% | Excellent | Meaningful passphrase, unpredictable, secure length |

## 🔑 Key Learnings

### ✅ Features of a Strong Password
- Minimum **12–16 characters**
- Includes **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols**
- Avoid common dictionary words & predictable patterns
- Use **passphrases** instead of single words
- Use a **unique password** for each account
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

---

## ⚠️ Password Attack Methods & Defense

| Attack Type | Description | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Brute Force | Tries all possible combinations | Longer and complex passwords |
| Dictionary Attack | Uses common words and leaked lists | Avoid real words and predictable patterns |
| Phishing | Tricks users into revealing login details | Verify links & emails before entering credentials |
| Credential Stuffing | Tries stolen passwords on other platforms | Use unique passwords + MFA |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The testing clearly shows that **password length, randomness, and character variety** have a major impact on security strength.  
Simple passwords are easy to crack, while **long, mixed-character passphrases** achieve the highest strength scores.

Combining strong passwords with **MFA** provides an extra layer of protection.
